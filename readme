Hello,
Welcome to the repository of my fifth year project in Creative Technology at ESILV.

In this repo you will find 7 different codes. 
The one called "receiver_bracelet" is the one that has been uploaded on the HexaRave structure's ESP32.
It's using

The others called "sender_bracelet_N_mpu" are the 6 codes uploaded on the 6 wristbands' ESP32. 
They are all the same excepted the ID value is changing so the structure's ESP32 understands which board is sending a message.

All the libraries used are esp_now.h, Wifi.h, FastLED.h, Adafruit_MPU6050.h, Adafruit_Sensor.h and Wire.h.
So make sure you download them all on Arduino's IDE before trying to make the code work.
